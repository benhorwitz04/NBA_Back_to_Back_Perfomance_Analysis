-- Question: What team's had the best overall record on the second day when competing in back-to-back contests? 
-- Additonally, what was the overall record for all combined teams across the NBA?

FROM second_day_games
WHERE prev_game_date IS NOT NULL
  AND AGE(GAME_DATE, prev_game_date) = INTERVAL '1 day'
